# rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock game using React

This is an expansion on the classic, made popular by The Big Bang Theory, just a few additional rules;
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
(and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors

The application takes a player gesture as input, and using random behaviour generates a counter gesture, and calculates the winner.
