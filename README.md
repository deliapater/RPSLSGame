# rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock game using React

This is an expansion on the classic, made popular by The Big Bang Theory, just a few additional rules;</br>
Scissors cuts Paper</br>
Paper covers Rock</br>
Rock crushes Lizard</br>
Lizard poisons Spock</br>
Spock smashes Scissors</br>
Scissors decapitates Lizard</br>
Lizard eats Paper</br>
Paper disproves Spock</br>
Spock vaporizes Rock</br>
(and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors</br>

The application takes a player gesture as input, and using random behaviour generates a counter gesture, and calculates the winner.
